# PHPServletsAPI

There are many MVC frameworks for building web applications in PHP, so writing a new one doesn’t make sense on a first glance. However, looking at existing solutions (such as Zend, Symfony), following problems are evident:
1. they are too complicated: they require a lot of learning and even after one manages to learn them, they are still hard to work with, because of complicated patterns one has to obey whenever writing a new component (controller, view, etc.). Overall, this makes development slower for no valid reason.
2. they are not modular: internal components are not really detachable, libraries that have nothing to do with MVC concerns are bundled in distribution (Zend DB, for example), and coupled with MVC part. They attempt to function like a layer above PHP (like Spring in Java, to whom they are generally in debt), which has both good sides (easy for programmers to do things just by delegating to one of countless libraries bundled, assuming you have learnt them) and bad side (you always get much more than you need, which brings a considerable performance lag). So, in a few words, this leaves careless programmers happy, but users of application unhappy (because they need to wait extra time for content being delivered).
3. they are overprogrammed: for example, some attempt to do fancy things such as Dependency Injection in a language that wasn’t designed to support it by parsing “annotations” in comments. Having strong programming inside is always good, but that needs to go hand in hand with spareness and modularity. When this fails to happen, users will suffer because of a maze of complex operations running inside just for the sake of programming beauty.
4. they are VERY slow: writing “good” old procedural code is faster by orders of magnitude because of above reasons.

The conclusion of above considerations is that the main purpose of a WEB application has been forgotten: that of serving users instead of programmers. A WEB application absolutely needs to be as fast and accurate as possible: all concerns must be channeled to bring a positive user experience. In PHP, which is after all a slow scripting language, this can only be achieved through a combination of minimalism and modularity. The only other solution would be to write a C extension to PHP that performs a web framework logic (stuff people at Phalcon did): this does bring huge performance benefits, but needs being installed on server (load extension on apache startup), plus it doesn’t guarantee this extension is free of memory leaks and other problems that might arise while running a third party library.

In light of above, PHP Servlets, built with concepts from Java Servlets API and Spring MVC in mind, it is supposed to be a small scalable web MVC API that is both very fast and modular.
